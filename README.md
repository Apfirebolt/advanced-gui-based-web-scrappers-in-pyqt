# A Collection of web-scrappers with GUI written in Pyside6/PyQt6

This would have multiple GUI programs to scrap pages using PySide6 and BeautifulSoup.

## Description

GUI based advanced web-scrappers. Scrapping can be applied to many use cases for instance, downloading images from a given web-page.

## List of Programs

### 1. GUI Based Scrapper created in Python using PySide6

This you can find in the file named 'gui_pyqt6_scrapper.py'. You can scrap a given page using multiple web-agents. It is important to 
keep switching agents to avoid getting blocked by websites under suspicion. This scrapper allows you to search for given tags in the page for example, you can search for all occurrences of h1 tag, p tag and so on. Additionally, you can download all the images from a scrapped page in a given folder which you get to choose.
